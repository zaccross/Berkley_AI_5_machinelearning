# Berkley_AI_5_machinelearning
Project 5 from Berkley CS188 Spring 2021 Course

This project is an exploration into machine learning, covering Perceptron, and Neural Nets for non-linear regression of Sin(X) and MNIST classification.
The highlight of the project is the MNIST classifier, without convolution, that achieves test accuracy >= 97%.

My major contributions were the implementation of the Neural Nets, using the pre-built Node classes and functions. This was a more hands on project than 
other NN projects I've done, since I did not get to use tensor flow or PyTorch to do the mid-level work. 

This project comes from the Berkley CS188 AI class, and more information can be found [here](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp21/project5/) 

IMPORTANT NOTE: I did not create / code most of the files in this repository. For the project, I edited models.py

This was a fun project, and a great introduction to machine learning in python!
